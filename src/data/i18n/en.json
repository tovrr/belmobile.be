    "blog_content_1": "The iPhone 15 Pro is a masterpiece of technology with its Super Retina XDR display. When an accident happens, the temptation to choose a cheap repair with generic parts is strong. However, here's why Belmobile always recommends original parts:\n\n1. **Image Quality**: Generic screens often have less vibrant colors and reduced brightness.\n2. **ProMotion Technology**: Only certified displays support the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n3. **True Tone & Sensors**: A non-compliant repair can permanently disable True Tone or Face ID.\n4. **Resale Value**: An iPhone with a non-original screen loses 30% of its value on the second-hand market.\n\nAt Belmobile (Anderlecht & Schaerbeek), we offer original screens with a 12-month warranty.",
