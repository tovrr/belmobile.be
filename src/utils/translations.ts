        "blog_excerpt_1": "Cracked your iPhone 15 Pro screen? Discover why original parts are crucial for maintaining warranty and image quality.",
        "blog_category_1": "Repair Guide",
        "blog_content_1": "The iPhone 15 Pro is a masterpiece of technology with its Super Retina XDR display. When an accident happens, the temptation to choose a cheap repair with generic parts is strong. However, here's why Belmobile always recommends original parts:\n\n1. **Image Quality**: Generic screens often have less vibrant colors and reduced brightness.\n2. **ProMotion Technology**: Only certified displays support the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n3. **True Tone & Sensors**: A non-compliant repair can permanently disable True Tone or Face ID.\n4. **Resale Value**: An iPhone with a non-original screen loses 30% of its value on the second-hand market.\n\nAt Belmobile (Anderlecht & Schaerbeek), we offer original screens with a 12-month warranty.",

        "blog_content_2": "The second-hand market in Belgium is in full swing. To get the best buyback price for your smartphone, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Deep Clean**: A clean device inspires confidence and facilitates inspection.\n2. **Box & Accessories**: If you still have the original box and charger, the value can increase by €10 to €20.\n3. **Deactivate Accounts**: Remember to remove your iCloud or Google account before coming to the store.\n4. **Transparency**: A small chip? Mention it! At Belmobile, we buy back even devices with minor defects.\n\nVisit one of our stores in Brussels for an instant estimate and payment in cash or via instant bank transfer.",

Lorsqu'un accident arrive, la tentation de choisir une réparation bon marché avec des pièces génériques est forte. Cependant, voici pourquoi Belmobile recommande toujours l'original :\n\n1. **Qualité d'image** : Les écrans génériques ont souvent des couleurs moins vives et une luminosité réduite.\n2. **Technologie ProMotion** : Seuls les écrans certifiés supportent le taux de rafraîchissement adaptatif de 120Hz.\n3. **True Tone & Capteurs** : Une réparation non conforme peut désactiver définitivement le True Tone ou le Face ID.\n4. **Valeur de Revente** : Un iPhone avec un écran non original perd 30% de sa valeur sur le marché de l'occasion.\n\nChez Belmobile (Anderlecht & Schaerbeek), nous proposons des écrans originaux avec une garantie de 12 mois.",

Signalez-le !

        "blog_category_1": "Reparatie Gids",
        "blog_content_1": "De iPhone 15 Pro is een technologisch meesterwerk met zijn Super Retina XDR-display. Wanneer er een ongeluk gebeurt, is de verleiding groot om te kiezen voor een goedkope reparatie met generieke onderdelen. Dit is echter de reden waarom Belmobile altijd originele onderdelen aanbeveelt:\n\n1. **Beeldkwaliteit**: Generieke schermen hebben vaak minder levendige kleuren en een lagere helderheid.\n2. **ProMotion-technologie**: Alleen gecertificeerde displays ondersteunen de adaptieve verversingssnelheid van 120Hz.\n3. **True Tone & Sensoren**: Een niet-conforme reparatie kan True Tone of Face ID permanent uitschakelen.\n4. **Restwaarde**: Een iPhone met een niet-origineel scherm verliest 30% van zijn waarde op de tweedehandsmarkt.\n\nBij Belmobile (Anderlecht & Schaarbeek) bieden wij originele schermen aan met een garantie van 12 maanden.",
