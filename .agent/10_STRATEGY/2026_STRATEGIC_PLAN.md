## 🚀 PHASE 2: TECHNOLOGICAL DOMINANCE (Q2 - Q3)

### 1. Belmobile OS (SaaS Play)
- **Strategy:** License the platform (Tracking, Apollo AI, Admin Panel) to other repair shops as a Whitelabel SaaS.
- **Revenue Model:** Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) + Setup fee.
- **Subsidies:** Position the software as a "Digital Transformation" tool to qualify for government grants (Belgium/EU) for small businesses.

### 2. B2B & Corporate Fleet Management
- **Strategy:** Target Brussels-based firms for bulk repair contracts.
- **Tooling:** Use the newly built B2B invoice and tracking features to offer "Zero Friction" business services.

### 3. "Green Belmobile" Initiative (Tree Planting)
- **Objective:** For every successful repair or device sold, Belmobile commits to planting a tree.
- **Goal:** Plant 5,000+ trees in 2026 through partnerships with reforestation organizations.
- **Marketing:** Use the "Green Certificate" in the tracking portal to show customers the impact of their repair (Sustainability Score).

3. **No Compromise on Quality:** A Belmobile certification must be the hardest and most respected in the industry.
