- **Tech:** One-click hydration of the Wizard state from a URL token.

### 2. Proactive SEO (Metadata v2)
- **Strategy:** Dynamically update 500+ device meta-titles daily with "Lowest Repair Price" vs "Highest Buyback" cash offer.
- **Tech:** Integration between `pricing.dal.ts` and Next.js `generateMetadata` for High-CTR Rich Snippets.

### 3. WhatsApp "Instant Booking"

## 🚀 LONG TERM: THE DOMINANCE ERA (Q3 2026 - 2027)

### 1. Remote Diagnostics Tool (Web-App)

- **Tech:** Browser-based Hardware API access to provide a "Certified Quote" without visiting the shop.

### 2. AR Service Point Locator
- **Strategy:** Augmented Reality "Navigator" for Brussels streets. Hold up your phone to see the nearest Belmobile shop glow on your screen.
- **UX:** Extreme "Cool Factor" that builds brand prestige among younger tech-savvy users (TikTok Viral potential).

### 3. The "Green Impact" Dashboard
- **Strategy:** Every user gets a profile showing their "Circular Economy Score". 
- **Impact:** "By repairing with us, you saved X.XX kg of E-waste and saved X.XX kg of CO2." Gamification of sustainability.
